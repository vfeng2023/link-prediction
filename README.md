# link-prediction
This is Vivian Feng's research project for Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.
Link prediction aims to identify unobserved edges in a network. For my senior research project, I implemented, evaluated, and analyzed three classes of link prediction algorithms -- local similarity indices, the global Random Walk with Restart Index, and the embedding method Node2Vec. Previously, I stored project files on Google Drive, but transfered them to Github for storage.

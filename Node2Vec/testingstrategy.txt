Now that Node2Vec is implemented, I need to figure out how to test it.
Two flavors of random walk: the one in the paper, and random walk with restart

Pq walk: 
- Weighted
- Need different values of p and q
- p,q in {0.5,0.25,1,4} grid hyperparameter search
- For hyperparameter choice of each graph:
- Use the settings given in Node2Vec to find the best graph:
    d = 128, r = 10, l = 80, k = 10
- Optimize the embedding parameters using Logistic Regression classifier and dot product combiner
- Using these parameters:
    - plot of d and AUC, d in {8,16,32,64,128}
    - plot of l and AUC
    plot of percent used as training set and AUC

Unweighted walk:
- for c in range(0.1,0.9,0.1)
- use these settings: d = 128, r = 10, l = 80
- FInd best c using Logisitc Regression classifier and dot product combiner
Produce these plots:
- Plot of c and AUC
- Plot of d and AUC, d in {8,16,32,64,128}
- plot of l and AUC, l = {10,..100}
- plot of percent used as training set and AUC


Logistic regression testing:
- Read graph
- split
- get graph's embeddings
- combine with op
- label as such: has edge -- 1. No edge -- 0
    - use equal number of edge and no edge
- train logreg
- predict on the test set by computing AUC
